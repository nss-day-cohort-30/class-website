We ran the business together for three years and decided to take the skills we had learned and move on to other opportunities. I took a position at Jimmy Johns and, in one year, worked my way up from cashier to GM. Although the company encouraged further growth, I found myself facing a choice; take on more responsibility (requiring me to move out of state) or stay in Nashville in my current position. Moving wasn't the right option for me at the time,  so I found myself looking for a new career. I wanted a career with room to grow, where the possibilities would be endless. My family mentioned software development for me. I started doing some research and worked on tutorials from CodeCademy and Udemy. Everything I learned about software made it the obvious choice. I joined the Jumpstart program at NSS, and fell in love. Shortly after finishing the Jumpstart program I applied for the 6 month course and was accepted. I am lucky to have the opportunity to continually learn and grow with this career. The challenges motivate me to expand my knowledge, feed my creativity, and become a better developer. "

Although I enjoyed the work, I found myself wishing I could create my own custom solutions. Software development gives me the opportunity to do just that. In my first web application, Drill Travel Tracker, I was able to combine my experience as an accountant and a U.S. Army officer with my acquired skills as a software developer to solve a financial challenge thousands of National Guard and Reserve service members experience every month. I’m proud of that and excited for what the future holds."

Along with my interest with software development, in my free time I explore machine learning, music tech, and interactive design. Over the course of several months while working on my Master's thesis in music, I began to realize that I love creating technology. I decided to take the plunge and study it full-time just a short time ago, and am loving it."
