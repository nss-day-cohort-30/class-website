I felt like I didn’t have enough fulfillment. I began to remember my love of computers and programming that I had in back high school. Programming gave me the constant learning, and the continuous growth that I had been yearning for. I started using Dark Basic which leads me to find Unity Engine. My passion for development continued to grow with each technology I learned about. I began to ask around to find a good starting point, and I was told about NSS. I am excited to see where this journey takes me as a software developer.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"id\": 24,\r\n        \"firstName\": \"Stephen\",\r\n        \"lastName\": \"Clark\",\r\n        \"portfolio\": \"\",\r\n        \"linkedin\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenclark369\",\r\n        \"github\": \"https://github.com/sc369\",\r\n        \"email\": \"stephenc369@gmail.com\",\r\n        \"reelThemIn\": '\"If you rebuke a wise man, he will love you.\" - The Book of Proverbs',\r\n        \"bio\": \"An apprentice software developer at Nashville Software School with experience in teaching, editing and church leadership, I am a graduate of the University of Cambridge who learns quickly and loves to explore new concepts and ideas.

I always enjoyed automating the flow of financial data through Excel spreadsheets, but I wanted to enhance my automation skills even more. In my part-time career as a communications officer in the Army National Guard, I often configured and employed out-of-the-box IT solutions. Although I enjoyed the work, I found myself wishing I could create my own custom solutions. Software development gives me the opportunity to do just that. In my first web application, Drill Travel Tracker, I was able to combine my experience as an accountant and a U.S. Army officer with my acquired skills as a software developer to solve a financial challenge thousands of National Guard and Reserve service members experience every month. I’m proud of that and excited for what the future holds.\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n\r\nexport default cohort","import React, { Component } from 'react'\r\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from
